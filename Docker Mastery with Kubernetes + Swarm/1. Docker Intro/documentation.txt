What is Serverless?
    You do not need to manage Servers 
    It saves you the stress of setting up a server, routing requests,
        defining rest resources and then creating methods to perform actions
        on those resources (GET, POST)
    
    It helps you focus on developing the application logic,
        and saves you time in manually creating the underlying infra
        and other methods or components
    
    Example: AWS Lambda


How does containers promote or aid serverless architecture?
    How AWS Lambda works under the hood will help clarify the question above
        (Check it out on a weekend)

Docker:
    It is just a different way of running and packing an appliaction and
    also moving it around your infrastructure


-> If you have done things manually, you would easily see the importance
    of the tools or frameworks which aids in automating those activities
    easily.
