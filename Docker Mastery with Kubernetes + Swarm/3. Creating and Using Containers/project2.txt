Scenario:
    You are a support engineer for a server farm that runs both Ubuntu
    and CentOS
    
    Work Ticket:
        Check the different curl versions on the two diferent OS

    Significance:
        In the pre-container, you would have to set up a virtual environment
        and wait for the components to install completely

        But currently, this can be done much faster and easier with the help 
        of containers

    Goal:
        Actions:

            run curl version in two different containers running two different OS
            Use these two OS in your containers 
                Image: ubuntu:14.04 
                        centos:7
        
            Check out the "docker container --rm" option so you can save cleanup

            Ensure curl is installed and on latest version for that distro
                Ubuntu: apt-get update && apt-get install curl
                Centos: yum update curl
        
        Check your curl version


    
    SOLUTIONS AND ISSUES:

        When trying to run an ubuntu container, why does it exit immediately, even when 
        bash was the main process?
            The main command for this container is bash, which does not have an interface 
                for interacting directly with users, hence it exits immediately after being executed.
            To make the container stay and interactive, we add the "-it" as an extra argument
        
        Commands:
            UBUNTU
            Run ubuntu container interactively 
                docker container run --name ubuntu1 -it ubuntu:14.04
            Update package and install curl
                apt-get update && apt-get install curl
            Check Curl Version installed
                curl -V
                    output -> curl 7.35.0
            
            CENTOS
            Run centos container interactively 
                docker container run --name centos1 -it centos:7
             Update package and install curl
                yum update curl
            Check Curl Version installed
                curl -V
                    output -> curl 7.29.0 

            --rm option 
                It automatically removes the container when it exits
                Automatic clean up of container
                

    Learnings:
        Terminal, Shell and command line:
            Command Line and terminal means the same thing
            Shell is the first interpreter, it converts human readable commands into actionable codes 
                the computer understands and implement.
            Shells do not have interfaces for interacting with users.
                User can only communicate with shells using Terminals/command line
