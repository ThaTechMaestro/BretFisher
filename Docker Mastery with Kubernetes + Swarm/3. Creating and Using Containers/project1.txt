Taking on Assignment as Project:
    Managing multiple containers:
        Run a nginx, mysql and httpd server
        Run all of them in detach mode "--detach" with an associated name --name  
            nginx should listen on -> 81:80
            httpd should listen on -> 8080:80
            mysql should listen on -> 3306:3306
        When running mysql use the --env option to pass in:
            MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
        Use docker container logs on mysql container to find the random password created on startup

        Cleaning all containers after succesful creation:
            docker container stop
            docker container rm 
                (Both can accept multiple names or IDs)
        
        Confirm with docker container ls commands to be sure everything is in order and the applications where cleaned
