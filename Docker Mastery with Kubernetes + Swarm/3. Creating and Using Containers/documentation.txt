What is Nginx?
    It is a multifunctional webserver.
    It can act as an email proxy, reverse proxy and load balancer.

Docker Architecture
    In simple form:
        It uses a client-server architecture (CLI-Server)

What is a daemon?
    It is a service that runs in the background and supervises
    the system or provides functionality to other processes

Differences between Containerd and Docker Engine?
    Beautiful explanation here:
        https://www.tutorialworks.com/difference-docker-containerd-runc-crio-oci/

    Docker Engine is an interface exposed to user to aid the creation and running of containers

    Containerd is a container runtime at a high level (responsible for creating and deleting containers)
            It pushes and pulls images, manages storage and networking and supervises the running of containers

    runc - It is responsible for creating and running containers (Low level, performs the actual creation)


What is backward compatibility?
    Actions or commands from the old model work well with the new model

----->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Docker structure
    dockerfile -> Image -> Container

    Images can not be edited but it can be shared as it is needed to create a container
    Images are more like what classes are to object, they are the blue print 
        containing important information needed to spin up an application/service within a container 
    
    Images are stored in a place called registry popularly called Docker Hub

    Docker daemon is called dockerd 
    Docker cli is called docker 
    Both the demon and cli are referred to as the docker engine

    Not going deep yet, developing and high level overview

Understanding what is going on in a docker container from the outside

 COMMANDS:
    displays list of processes in the running container:
        docker container top name_of_container 
            
    display detailed details of container in json format (does not tell us much about what the container is doing, more of config details)
        docker container inspect name_of_container

    Performance stats of container
        docker container stats name_of_container

Container only runs as the command we run on startup runs.

What is a package manager?
    It is a collection of Software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading,
    configuring and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.
    They are more like the cleaners for computer programs in an operating System

Docker Network Concepts
    OSI - Open Systems Interconnection model

    Every layer in the OSI Model produces an output for the next layer:
        This output is called PDU:
            PDU - Protocol Data Unit 
            Protocol: Defining the rules to be followed for effective communication 
                        or smooth operation.
            
    The OSI Layer:
        Layer 7,6 & 5 makes up the application layer 
        7. Application 
            The pdu for this layer is messages
            The protocols for this layer includes:
                HTTP, FTP, SMTP and DHCP 

        6. Presentation
        5. Session
            The pdu for this layer is messages/data (in bits)
        
        4. Transport
                This protocols in this layer provides host to host communication services for applications 

                The pdu for this layer is the segment
                The protocols at the transport layer are:
                    TCP:
                        It is connection oriented, connection must be established before transfer of data.
                        Also reliability of data transfered is prioritised
                        It focuses more on reliability

                    UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
                        It is connectionless, a connection is not required for transfer of data
                        It prioritises speed more, that is the time at which data arrives is of higher importance than the data itself 
                            Usecases involved:
                                Streaming media (audio, video)
                                Simple query/response applications (DNS Lookups)

                    Addition of ports to the pdu (Client and service ports)



        3. Network/Internet Layer
                 The pdu for this layer is the packet, it deals with adding ip addresses 
                    It addients the ip adderss of the client and service together
                    It transfer data to a particular address in a network


        2. Data Link
                The pdu for this layer is the frame

        1. Physical Layer
            The pdu for this layer is the bits or symbol
    
    
    How computers or containers on the same network easily communicates with each other?
        I think there will be an IP address lookup table.

 COMMANDS:
    Start a new container interactively
        docker container run -it
    
    Run additional commands within a container
        docker container exec -it

    Run additional applications within a running container as the main process
    Using the run command the addditonal appliation becomes the main process in the running container 
    Once we exit or kill the additional application, the container exits or stops
        docker container run -it --name proxy nginx bash
    
    Run additional application/process within a running container without it being the main process 
    Using the exec command the additional application becomes an extra process in line with the main 
    process running within the container 
    Once we exit  or kill this additional application, the container still run, as it keeps the main 
    process running.
        docker container exec -it mysql bash
