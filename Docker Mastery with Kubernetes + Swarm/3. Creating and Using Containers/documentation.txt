Differences between Containerd and Docker Engine?
    Beautiful explanation here:
        https://www.tutorialworks.com/difference-docker-containerd-runc-crio-oci/

    Docker Engine is an interface exposed to user to aid the creation and running of containers

    Containerd is a container runtime at a high level (responsible for creating and deleting containers)
            It pushes and pulls images, manages storage and networking and supervises the running of containers

    runc - It is responsible for creating and running containers (Low level, performs the actual creation)


What is backward compatibility?
    Actions or commands from the old model work well with the new model

----->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Docker structure
    dockerfile -> Image -> Container

    Images can not be edited but it can be shared as it is needed to create a container
    Images are more like what classes are to object, they are the blue print 
        containing important information needed to spin up an application/service within a container 
    
    Images are stored in a place called registry popularly called Docker Hub

    Docker daemon is called dockerd 
    Docker cli is called docker 
    Both the demon and cli are referred to as the docker engine

    Not going deep yet, developing and high level overview
